## üîí Security Configuration

The application utilizes Spring Security to ensure robust security measures. Here‚Äôs an overview of the security setup:

### üõ°Ô∏è Authentication

- Basic Authentication: HTTP Basic Authentication to secure the application. Users must provide a username and password to access protected endpoints.

### üîê Authorization

- Role-Based Access Control: Access to different API endpoints is restricted based on user roles. The roles and their permissions are as follows:
  - **USER**: Can access read-only endpoints for books.
  - **MANAGER**: Can access read-only endpoints for patrons and records.
  - **ADMIN**: Has full access, including create, update, and delete operations for books, patrons, and borrowing records.

### üîë User Details Management
- JDBC Authentication: User details and roles are managed using a JDBC-based authentication system. User credentials are stored securely with hashed passwords using Bcrypt.

### üö´ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- CSRF Protection: CSRF protection is disabled for simplicity in local development. Ensure to enable CSRF protection in production environments for enhanced security.

## üß™ Unit Testing

The Library Management System application includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure the functionality of the API endpoints. These tests are designed to validate key operations across the core entities of the system: **Books**, **Patrons**, and **Borrowing Records**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Testing Tools and Frameworks

- **JUnit 5**: Used for writing and executing test cases.
- **Spring Boot Test**: Provides testing support for Spring Boot applications.
- **MockMvc**: Facilitates testing of Spring MVC controllers by simulating HTTP requests and verifying responses.
- **Mockito**: Used to mock the service layer dependencies, enabling isolated testing of controllers.
- **Jackson ObjectMapper**: Helps in serializing and deserializing JSON objects within the tests.

### üöÄ How to Run the Tests

- **Ensure Your Environment is Set Up**: Make sure that your development environment is properly configured with the required dependencies. This includes having Maven and JDK installed, as well as setting up the necessary database configurations.
- **Run Tests via Maven**:
    - Execute the following command in the terminal to run all tests:
        ```bash
        mvn test
        ```
    - Alternatively, you can use your IDE's built-in testing features to run the test suite.

- **Verify Test Results**: After executing the tests, Maven will provide a summary of the results. Ensure that all tests pass successfully. If any tests fail, review the detailed logs to identify and resolve issues.



## ‚ùó Exception Handling

The application uses a global exception handler to manage errors gracefully. The following are the custom exceptions used:

- NotFoundException: Returns a 404 status when a resource is not found.
- BadRequestException: Returns a 400 status for bad requests.
- Generic Exception: Returns a 500 status for all other unhandled exceptions.

## üíª Technology Stack

- Java 22
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Hibernate/JPA
- MySQL (or any other relational database)
- Maven for dependency management
